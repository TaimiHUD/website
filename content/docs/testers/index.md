## Alpha Test {#alpha}

The current focus of our alpha test builds is [marker interactions](/faq/#interact),
and [achievement filtering](/faq/#achievements) is also included.

The latest information about our ongoing alpha test including instructions and known issues is currently recorded in a Discord channel dedicated to testing experimental features.

## Beta Test {#beta}

A less alpha-quality build featuring [achievement filters](/faq/#achievements) is hopefully coming soon...

## Prerelease {#rc}

For the slightly less adventurous, incoming new features are often available to try early through [Nexus pre-releases](/install-guide/#rc) before they're deemed ready. If you use these versions, please [report](/faq/#help) any bugs found so we can fix them before a stable release is made!

Note that pre-releases are no longer required to get access to basic pathing functionality.
